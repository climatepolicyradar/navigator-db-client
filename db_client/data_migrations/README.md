# Data Migrations

The data files in this folder provision key info in the event that we are building the database from scratch. This makes sure we have language, geography, and geo statistics data, as well as basic metadata required for the CCLW and UNFCCC corpus.

All other migrations of our data rather than our schema can be found in our [data-migrations](https://github.com/climatepolicyradar/data-migrations) repo.

Disclaimer: The taxonomies above are likely now out of date. Please check in the data migrations folder for the most up to date taxonomies.
